# 📌 RFID Based Attendance System using ESP32

An IoT-based smart attendance system built using ESP32 and MFRC522 RFID module that records student attendance with real-time Date, Time, and Status (Check-In / Check-Out) and uploads data to Google Sheets via WiFi.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses RFID cards to automatically mark attendance.  
When a valid RFID card is scanned:

- ESP32 reads the unique UID
- Fetches real-time date & time
- Marks Check-In or Check-Out
- Uploads data to Google Sheets

This eliminates manual attendance errors and improves efficiency.

## 📡 Working Principle

1. RFID card is scanned.
2. ESP32 reads the UID.
3. UID is matched with registered users.
4. Date and time are fetched.
5. Attendance is logged with status.
6. Data is uploaded to Google Sheets.

## 📊 Real-Time Attendance Log (Google Sheets Output)

The system automatically records:

- Name  
- Date  
- Time  
- Status (Check-In / Check-Out)  

Below is the real-time attendance sheet generated by the system:

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Face Recognition Integration
- Cloud Database (Firebase / MongoDB)
- Admin Web Dashboard
- Email / SMS Notifications
- Monthly Attendance Report Generation
